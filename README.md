Instructions

Open up the database file in the DB Browser for SQLite application to see it.
Go ahead and click around a little bit to familarize yourself with the database.
When you're ready to start the exercise, click the tab labeled "Execute SQL", type in your query and run it.
For each of the following exercises, provide the appropriate query. Yes, even the ones that are expressed in the form of questions. Everything from class and the Sqlite documentation for SQL keywords and functions is fair game.

Query all of the entries in the Genre table

Using the INSERT statement, add one of your favorite artists to the Artist table.

Using the INSERT statement, add one, or more, albums by your artist to the Album table.

Using the INSERT statement, add some songs that are on that album to the Song table.

Write a SELECT query that provides the song titles, album title, and artist name for all of the data you just entered in. Use the LEFT JOIN keyword sequence to connect the tables, and the WHERE keyword to filter the results to the album and artist you added.

Reminder: Direction of join matters. Try the following statements and see the difference in results.
SELECT a.Title, s.Title FROM Album a LEFT JOIN Song s ON s.AlbumId = a.AlbumId;
SELECT a.Title, s.Title FROM Song s LEFT JOIN Album a ON s.AlbumId = a.AlbumId;
